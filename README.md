# My Canadian Adventure Blog (Age 16)

This blog documents my and a friend's separate three-month adventures in Canada when we were 16 years old. I spent my time in Winnipeg, while my friend explored Halifax. We both documented our individual experiences in real-time.

Notably, we created this website ourselves, and through this project, we significantly improved our writing and communication skills.
