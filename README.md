# My Canadian Adventure Blog (Age 16)

This blog documents my and a friend's separate three-month adventures in Canada when we were 16 years old. I spent my time in Winnipeg, while my friend explored Halifax. We both documented our individual experiences in real-time.

Notably, we created this website ourselves, and through this project, we significantly improved our writing and communication skills. We also successfully marketed the blog using our social media networks, resulting in engaging interactions and a wider audience reach.
